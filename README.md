# Natural-Language-Processing

In this notebook, I used "News API" to pull the latest news articles about Bitcoin and Etherium to determine the sentiment scores for each coin.

Next, I used NLTK and Python to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word counts for Bitcoin and Etherium.

Finally, I used Named Entity Recognition to visualize the tags using SpaCy.
